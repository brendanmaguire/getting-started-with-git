# Getting Started with git Presenation

This is a presentation describing the basics needed to become productive with git.

## Generating the presenation html
The presenation is written in markdown and can be compiled using [landslide](https://github.com/adamzap/landslide).

* Install landslide

`
pip install landslide
`

* Run landslide to generate the presentation html

`
landslide landslide.cfg --copy-theme
`
